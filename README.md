# objectDetection

## Intro
The objectDetection project builds on top of a platform facilitating inverse and forward kinematics and control of an open-chain robot arm with 5 DOF. With a camera mounted to the end effector of the robot, the program is able to identify objects in the robot's proximity, track their position (movements) and calculate their position.

The code operates with the following libraries:
OpenCV
NumPy
PyQt5

Below, individual files and their purpose will be described.
